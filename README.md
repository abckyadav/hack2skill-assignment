## Problem Statement:

Server should call the YouTube API continuously in background (async) with
some interval (say 10 seconds) for fetching the latest videos for a predefined
search query and should store the data of videos (specifically these fields -
Video title, description, publishing datetime, thumbnails URLs and any other
fields you require) in a database with proper indexes.

● A GET API which returns the stored video data in a paginated response
sorted in descending order of published datetime.
● A basic search API to search the stored videos using their title and
description.
● Dockerize the project.
● It should be scalable and optimised.
